This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: index out of range when accessing elements of an array.  The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, which attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds, leading to a runtime crash. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a corrected version, incorporating checks to prevent this error.  Understanding array bounds and implementing robust checks is crucial to prevent unexpected crashes in your Swift applications.
